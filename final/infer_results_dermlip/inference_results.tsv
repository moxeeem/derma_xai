This is a photo of the lower limb showing extensive ulceration, erosion, and crusting, consistent with the clinical presentation of squamous cell carcinoma. Squamous cell carcinomas are common malignant tumors that typically grow slowly but can invade surrounding tissues if not treated promptly. Treatment usually involves surgical excision, cryotherapy, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.	43.658180236816406	9.56364196523753	0.33707865168539325	0.040204462206580895
